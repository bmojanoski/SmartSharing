# SmartSharing | Databases Course Project

**Short name of the project:** Smart Sharing

**Long name of the project:** Web application for donating furniture and household items

**What is the main idea of the project?**
There are many socially vulnerable families, but also a large number of usable things that end up in a landfill. Guided by this, the idea of this project is to merge these two problems into one solution. Donation of the already used works is the assistance of socially vulnerable families, even more so for the environment.
