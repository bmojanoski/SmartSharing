# SmartSharing | Databases Course Project
This project is made for purposes of Databases Course at my faculty. I started by drawing the ER diagram, then transforming the ER diagram into a relational model with relational patterns. Then I wrote a SQL for creating tables and filling the data. We used PostgreSQL at course. Finally, in ASP.NET, I made this web application.
